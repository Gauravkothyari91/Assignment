    <strong>9. What are self-closing tags? Write a brief note on meta tags.</strong>
    <h1>self-closing tags</h1>
    <p>A traditional HTML tag such as <p>, <div>, <section>, etc., had an opening tag and a closing tag. However, due to their fundamental structure, void components in HTML, such as images and links, do not technically require closing tags. Images and links cannot have content - they are pointers to an element installed on the website.
        Instead of including independent opening and closing tags in more modern HTML variants such as XHTML, developers employ a self-closing tag that includes a "/" within the carets (\<>). For example â€“ <img src="image/circle" alt="example" /></p>
        <h1>Meta tags</h1>
        <p>The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

            <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
            
            Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
            
            Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
            
            There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag</p>
