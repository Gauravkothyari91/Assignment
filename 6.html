    <strong>6. Create an ordered list of HTML tags. Each list item must include the tag name and some information
        about the tag.</strong>
    <h1>Ordered list</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Div <br>
            The (div) HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout
            until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model
            like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).</li><br>
        <li>footer <br>
            The (footer) HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root
            element. A (footer) typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links
            to related documents.</li><br>
        <li>header <br>
            The (header) HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</li><br>
            <li>Strong <br>
                The (strong) HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.</li><br>
                <li>Table <br>
                    The (table) HTML element represents tabular data â€” that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.
                    </li>
    </ol>
