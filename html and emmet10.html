    <strong>10. What are global attributes? List any 5 global attributes.</strong>
    <h1>GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES</h1>
    <P>Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements.

        Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. That means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though using those elements means that the document is no longer HTML5-compliant. For example, HTML5-compliant browsers hide content marked as <foo hidden>â€¦</foo>, even though <foo> is not a valid HTML element. <br> <br>
            List of global attributes <br> <br>
            accesskey
            Provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current element. This attribute consists of a space-separated list of characters. The browser should use the first one that exists on the computer keyboard layout. <br><br>
            <b>autocapitalize</b>
            Controls whether and how text input is automatically capitalized as it is entered/edited by the user. It can have the following values:
            
            off or none, no autocapitalization is applied (all letters default to lowercase)
            on or sentences, the first letter of each sentence defaults to a capital letter; all other letters default to lowercase
            words, the first letter of each word defaults to a capital letter; all other letters default to lowercase
            characters, all letters should default to uppercase <br><br>
            <b>autofocus</b>
            Indicates that an element is to be focused on page load, or as soon as the <dialog> it is part of is displayed. This attribute is a boolean, initially false <br><br>
                <b>class</b>
                A space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements via the class selectors or functions like the method Document.getElementsByClassName(). <br><br>
                <b></b>contenteditable
                An enumerated attribute indicating if the element should be editable by the user. If so, the browser modifies its widget to allow editing. The attribute must take one of the following values:
                
                true or the empty string, which indicates that the element must be editable;
                false, which indicates that the element must not be editable.</P>
