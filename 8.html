    <h1>Full stack web development tech stack</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>TECH STACK</b></dt>
        <dd>A tech stack is short for technology stack. It’s a list of all the technology services used to build and run
            a single application or website.
            <br>
            <br>
            We call it a stack because you can visualize the technologies being stacked on top of each other, from
            frontend to backend, to build an application.
            <br>
            <br>
            A tech stack may also be called a solutions stack, technology infrastructure, or the data ecosystem.
            <br><br> The exact combination of technologies will vary depending on the product, the scale of the company
            and the decisions and preferences of the system’s architects. That said, the elements are often similar.

        <dt><b>MERN STACK</b></dt>
        <dd>The MERN stack is a very popular JavaScript-based tech stack for web development. It’s made up of MongoDB,
            Express, React, and Node. <br> <br>
            The MERN stack is designed to make the development process smooth and easy by combining:

            a NoSQL database
            the Express framework for simplifying and organizing backend code
            React for organizing the frontend
            Node as the runtime environment that executes Javascript outside the web browser</dd>
        <br> <br>
        <dt><b>MEAN STACK</b></dt>
        <dd>The MEAN stack stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.It’s similar to the MERN stack, except it uses
            Angular instead of React. <br> <br>
            how is MEAN different from MERN? <br> <br>
            While they are both based on JavaScript, Angular is backed by Google and React is backed by Meta. Angular
            also has a steeper learning curve, though it handles abstraction and also manages files.
            <br>
            While it can be slower to code in, it might be better for enterprise level projects. Angular also allows
            data flow in two directions, while React only allows data to be passed from parent to child component.
        </dd>
        <br><br>
        <dt><b>LAMP STACK</b></dt>
        <dd>The LAMP stack is made up of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python. <br>
            Apache and PHP were quite popular in previous decades, which made this stack popular. LAMP was made for
            enterprise level applications with heavy traffic and daily data transfer.
            <br>
            However, it can only be used on machines running the Linux operating system.
            <br>
            It’s also not a great fit for modern web technologies demanding more dynamic, responsive (i.e. used across
            different devices), cross-platform and highly secure options.
        </dd>
        <br><br>
        <dt><b>SERVERLESS STACK</b></dt>
        <dd>The serverless stack allows you to build an application without maintaining and managing a server. Rather,
            your application is hosted in the cloud.
            <br>
            There are still servers involved in the serverless stack, but they are abstracted away from the day-to-day
            work of the developer. Developers just need to package their code in containers and deploy it. The
            serverless stack will automatically scale up and down as needed.
            <br>
            The serverless stack supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Golang (GO), and C#.
            <br>
            It can be a great option for small companies that don’t want to dedicate as much time to designing and
            maintaining their infrastructure.
            <br>
            It’s also pay as you go, meaning when a serverless function is sitting idle, it doesn’t cost anything.
        </dd> <br><br>
        <dt><b>MEVN STACK</b></dt>
        <dd>The MEVN stack is made up of MongoDB, Express, Vue, and Node.
            <br>
            Similar to the MERN and MEAN stacks, the major difference is it uses Vue as the framework for writing
            frontend code.
            <br>
            Both Vue and React are lightweight, use the virtual DOM, and have similar performance. <br><br>
            So how is MEVN different from MERN and MEAN? <br><br>
            The major difference is that Vue is a framework (React is a library). This means it’s more opinionated and
            less flexible.
            <br>
            It comes with out-of-box plugin systems, built-in directives, transitions, and so on. The Vue core team also
            created companion libraries for routing and state management: Vue-router, Vuex for state management and Vue
            CLI.
            <br>
            Vue also has two-way data binding, instead of parent-to-child like React.
            <br>
            Vue is easy to learn, though it might not be the best choice for mobile-heavy applications or companies
            wishing to scale.
