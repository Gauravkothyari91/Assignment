<h1>Programming Quotes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>“Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.”
            ― Rick Cook, The Wizardry Compiled
            </li>
        <li>“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”
            ― Martin Fowler
            </li>
        <li>“The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.”
            ― Donald E. Knuth, Selected Papers on Computer Science
            </li>
        <li>“Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day.
            Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.”
            ― Muhammad Waseem</li>
        <li>“Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.”
            ― Edward V. Berard</li>
